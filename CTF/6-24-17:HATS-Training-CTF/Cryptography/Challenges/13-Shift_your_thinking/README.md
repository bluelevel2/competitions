# Shift your thinking
I found a note containing several weird looking words, can you help me decode them? I remember in class they said I had to rotate them... not sure what they mean.

## Questions
1. **ohmmFnj**
2. **YWJJywzsp**
3. **RbqsABkdw**

## Steps

### Question 2
1. See 'rotate' in the hint
2. Immediately think [Caesar Cipher](http://www.xarg.org/tools/caesar-cipher/)
3. Change key to 'guess'
4. Input 'YWJJywzsp'
5. Get the flag
