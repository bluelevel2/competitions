## Question

Open the file pwlist.txt. This file is a list of passwords. Count the number of times each character is used in the file. Take the top two most frequently used characters and add their counts together. Submit this result as your answer. For example, if the file contained the following passwords:

abcd dfga ajkl

Then the individual counts for the characters would be: a = 3, d = 2, b = 1, c = 1, e = 1, f = 1, g = 1, j = 1, k = 1, l = 1. The top two most frequently used characters are "a" and "d" and the sum of their counts is 5.
