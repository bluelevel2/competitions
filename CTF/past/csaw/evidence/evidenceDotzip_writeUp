(as a note, we didn't get the point but we were really close to the flag.... it was under our noses when we did this)

CHALLENGE:
As part of CSAW CTF's ongoing efforts to terminate cheaters with extreme
prejudice, we were supposed to have evidence incriminating a handful of teams
in this zip file. I do not know what happened, but I do not think the evidence
actually made it in there...

Process:
Download the Zip file

so from when we get the zipped file, i tried to unzip it

to my surprise i find that all the files that come out of the zipped file were blank
so i had to ask around the slack to see what could it be.

so my friend said that we should look at the zipped file in a hexeditor and he
uses ghex, i am using ghex for my hex editor

me and one of my friend came to the conclusion that we had to be very tedious
and try to change all the compression methods.

then at that point, i didn't want to be tedious and fix everything

-- end of the CTF --

from when i check other people's write ups i came to find out how to find the
flag

i was angry, sad, and a little embarrassed.

when i opened it back up in ghex to find it right there. in plain sight
