# ROT-13 Time's up!
Category: Easy

## Question

The ROT-13 cipher is a very simple mechanism to encode data and hide the meaning from casual observation. To encode things in ROT-13, you simply shift the value of a given character up the alphabet by 13 characters. Thus an 'A' becomes an 'N' and 'k' becomes 'x'.

Create a script that does a ROT-11 encoding of both uppercase and lower case and use it to encode the following gibberish (which will reveal a secret phrase): Ctktg vxkt je

For ROT-11, use the following mapping of characters:

``` A => L B => M Z => K a => l b => m z => k ```

NOTE: You do not need to do enciphering of the spaces, thus the answer will have the same number of words with the same number of letters and spaces in the same places.

For example, if you ROT-11 encode the gibberish 'Wtaad' your answer would be the following: Hello.
