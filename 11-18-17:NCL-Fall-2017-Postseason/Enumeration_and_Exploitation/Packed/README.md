# Packed
A hacker has obfuscated a flag through some sort of encoding mechanism. While we don't have the decoder, we do have the program used to encode the flag. Help us recover the flag.

## Questions
1. What is the decoded flag?

## Answers
1. SKY-UARV-6193

## Walkthroughs
Looking at the code in `Packed.py`, we see that the flag is data.bin reversed.

A simple XOR reversal reveals the flag. Solution in `Solution.py`.
