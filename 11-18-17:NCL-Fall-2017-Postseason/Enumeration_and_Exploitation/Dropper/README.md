We discovered a piece of malware on an officer's computer. Analyze it and understand what it is doing.

## Questions
1. What programming language is this malware written in?
2. What cipher is used to encrypt part of the malware?
3. What is the hidden flag found in the payload of the malware?

## Answers
1. JavaScript
2. RC4
3. SKY-WELX-7781

## Walkthroughs
We can guess this is JavaScript from the key words `var`, `function`, and `document.getElementById`.

Looking through it, we can see one huge encoded string with it's encoding method shown.

Some quick research reveals this as `Base64`.

Attached in `Decoded.js` is the decoded JavaScript.

While reading through the code, we come across this part of encoding.

```
i = (i + 1) % 256;
j = (j + s[i]) % 256;
x = s[i];
s[i] = s[j];
s[j] = x;
```

Some quick Googling of this reveals the encryption cipher `RC4`.

Reading about `RC4`, we know that it uses a key to encrypt some data.

We can use `7397HYihei387IY3` as the key, and the encrypted string as the data to get the flag.
