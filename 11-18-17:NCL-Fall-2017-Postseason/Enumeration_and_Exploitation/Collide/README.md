# Collide
We have found a program that is being used to validate flags. See if you can find correct flag for this program.

## Questions
1. What programming language is this program written in?
2. What flag will successfully validate against this program?

## Answers
1. Python
2. SKY-XSKU-2479

## Walkthroughs
Using `uncompyle6`, we can decode the `.pyc` file into a readable format. Decompiled version of file is in this folder named `Collide.py`.

From here, all it takes is a simple XOR reversal to get the flag.

```
arr = [146, 136, 252, 123, 207, 114, 151, 103, 129, 108, 40, 19, 176]
compArr = [193, 195, 165, 86, 151, 33, 220, 50, 172, 94, 28, 36, 137]

for x in xrange(len(arr)):
  print chr(compArr[x] ^ arr[x]),
```

Which gives us the flag `SKY-XSKU-2479`.
