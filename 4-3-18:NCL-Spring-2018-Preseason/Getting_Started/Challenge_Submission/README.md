# Getting Started
Learn how to submit challenge answers on the Cyber Skyline Platform. 

Generally, you can enter free-form response and Cyber Skyline's challenge engine will intelligently parse your response. The safest option is to copy any exact text from the source, such that if the answer for a browser & its version should be "Chrome 65.0.3325.181" just enter exactly that. Some answer submission boxes will prompt for a specific formatting to help avoid ambiguity.

## Questions
1. If we ask you what's our company name, you can just enter "Cyber Skyline" Go ahead, try it out! 
2. Great job! Next up is numeric inputs. If we asked you how many States does the United States have? You can actually enter either "50" or "fifty!" Give it a try!
3. Getting IP addresses correct is very important in cybersecurity. So if we ask for an IP address, the input box will actually make sure you're entering a valid IP address. Try submitting the IP address "8.8.8.8"
4. MAC addresses are also just as important to get correct, so we have a hexadecimal input that automatically helps you with entering MAC addresses. Try entering the MAC address "00:3e:e1:c4:5d:df" and you'll see that the input box will automatically capitalize the hexadecimal value for you to avoid ambiguity.
5. Hexadecimal can also be used for other things - it's a good way to represent binary values that aren't easy for human eyes to read - and for these situations, it doesn't make sense to have colons separating each byte, so we also have a plain hexadecimal input. Try submitting: "5ac4841b9000090dbefdda26" 
6. Awesome! Finally, we have a date time picker. Cyber Skyline uses ISO 8601 standard date representation and a 24 hour time representation. So January 30th, 2018 9:45pm would be "2018/01/30 21:45" If that sounds confusing, don't worry, we have a great date and time picker to help you enter the date and time. Simply click into the input box and you'll get a small popup modal. Try using the popup modal to select April 15th, 2018 11:30pm
