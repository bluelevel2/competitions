# Ethical Hacking (Basic) 3
## Question (Created by stoner_john@bah.com from the CyberSim team)

In the context of password security: a simple dictionary attack involves loading a dictionary file (a text file full of dictionary words) into a cracking application such as L0phtCrack or John the Ripper, and running it against user accounts located by the application. The larger the word and word fragment selection, the more effective the dictionary attack is. The brute force method is the most inclusive - though slow. Usually, it tries every possible letter and number combination in its automated exploration.

If you would use both brute force AND dictionary combined together to have variations of words, you would call that a _________ attack. Type the word that goes into the blank into the text field below, in all lower case.

## Answer
hybrid
