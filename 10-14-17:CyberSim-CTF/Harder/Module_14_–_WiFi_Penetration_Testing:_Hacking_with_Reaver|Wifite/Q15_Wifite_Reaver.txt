Solution Explanation for PenTest Module 14 WiFi Penetration Testing 15

Reaver and Wifite prey on open WPS in access points. The screenshot
output is seen after the wifite is typed into linux command line.
I used Kali Linux which already had wifite installed.It showed that
there were three access points that had WPS enabled: Verizon-291LW-DE3C,
NETGEAR08 and, NETGEAR18. WPS enabling allows tools like reaver and 
wifite to obtain the keys and passphrases.
