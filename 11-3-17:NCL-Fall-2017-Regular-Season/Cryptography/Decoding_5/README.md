# Decoding 5
We found a cipher wheel along with several messages we suspect were encrypted with it. See if you can decode them.

```
=== Begin Encrypted Messages ===
1. set(A, T): INEE MAX YBKFPTKX HYY MAX YMI LXKOXK
2. set(B, D): UGPF OG VJG RCUUYQTF JCUJGU
==== End Encrypted Messages ====
```

## Questions
1. What is the plaintext of the first message?
2. What is the plaintext of the second message?

## Answers
1. PULL THE FIRMWARE OFF THE FTP SERVER
2. SEND ME THE PASSWORD HASHES

## Walkthroughs

You could do two things here. Either look at the chart and match up the set(x, y) with their respective shift number. Or brute force the key using a typical [shift cipher brute forcer](https://www.xarg.org/tools/caesar-cipher/).
