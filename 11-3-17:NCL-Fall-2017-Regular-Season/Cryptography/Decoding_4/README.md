### Walkthroughs

It took me a while to find out what font this was, but I eventually found it by going on [rumkin](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/substitution.php) since it was what most of the Crypto challenges in the Gymnasium were based off of and seeing Pigpen in the dropdown.

From there it was just matching the letters up with their counterpart and decoding the message.
