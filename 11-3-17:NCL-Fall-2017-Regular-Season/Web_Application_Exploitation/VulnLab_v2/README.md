# VulnLabs v2
VulnLabs v2 launched this fall and they started a bug bounty program where they will award anyone that finds the flag hidden in their code 150 points! DO NOT tamper with the tid value.

## Questions
1. What is the flag value?

## After
http://vulnlabs.cityinthe.cloud/threat-share/ai?file=../index.js was the route to extract the server file.

I only got as far as http://vulnlabs.cityinthe.cloud/threat-share/ai?file=../app.js, since I assumed the server file was named after the ExpressJS framework, not native Node.JS.
